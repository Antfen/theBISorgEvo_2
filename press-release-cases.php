            <h2>3D WOVEN  STRUCTURES</h2>
            <h3>RCA: Oluwaseyi  Sosanya</h3>
         </span>
         <p>Conceived by Royal College of Art graduate Oluwaseyi  Sosanya for his graduate project, 3D Woven Structures shares similar layering techniques to 3D printing, but with a further step to hold structures in place.
            Sosanya took inspiration from the mechanics of sewing and industrial knitting machines to create his revolutionary woven structures in 3D format.
         </p>
         <p>Structures are created via guide tubes, with the initial winding programmed to run prior to the  Sosanya.
            In collaboration with footwear designers Lixian Teng and Tomiwa Adeosun, Sosanya has created a woven shoe sole from one continuous thread with auxetic properties,

         <p>which allows the woven structure to become thicker perpendicular to an applied stretching force.</p>
         <p>Shoe soles are one commercial application, but Sosanya is confident the technology could also create medical implants and architectural structures.</p>

            <h2>GRAVITY  SKETCH </h2>
            <h3>RCA: Daniela Paredes, Oluwaseyi Sosanya, Pierre Paslier, Guillaume Couch</h3>
         </span>

         <p>Conceived in London a year ago, the initial idea and vision for Gravity Sketch developed as a group project between four Innovation Design Engineering students of the Royal College of Art.</p>

         <p>The team initially developed experiments to question the creative process, image visualisation and the limitations of existing creative tools in 3D computing software. Within a short time the team developed their first prototype and early testing swiftly highlighted the potential of the concept to those who took part in initial tests.</p>

      <p>Further development followed and Gravity Sketch was patented in February 2014.</p>

      <p>The British Invention Show team are proud to offer a platform for raising investment for this innovative vision for creating 3D.</p>

            <h3>RCA: Daniela Paredes</h3>
         </span>
         <p>R-Tex is a reactive textile controlled digitally and animated through bio-data produced through sensors. It changes appearance through the movement of its fibres controlled by a micro-actuation system integrated in the woven fibres.</p>

            <h3>RCA: lise Pape</h3>
         </span>
         <p>The Path System utilises visual and tactile clues to aid individuals with walking difficulties to walk with greater confidence.</p>
         <p>This in turn leads to greater independence which then reduces social isolation.</p>
         <p>Lise obviously cares greatly for the problems associated with frailty and Path is a great contribution to helping others.</p>

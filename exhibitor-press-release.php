                  <p style="padding: 20px">Implementing systematic reuse and customize existing system has proven to be a difficult process. As web engineers continue to struggle with cost and time, reuse has emerged as a sound engineering principle and practice in many fields. However, technology for completely integrated user interface, reuse design, customization and implementation is still immature. Hence, this toolkit provide a novel visual object sharing mechanism for designing, customizing, reusing and  visualizing web elements to provide a breakthrough solution.</p>

                  <p style="padding: 20px">The age of mass travel has arrived. Today it is estimated that over 2 billion cross border tourists ply the planet. Being constantly on the move has led us all to experience a new, uncomfortable and unhealthy environment – resting and sleeping in a seat. Seats were not designed for this purpose and neither were we.
                     Pillows, cushions and neck supports don’t address the CORE problem – gravity.

                  <div style="display: block; margin-top: 300px; padding: 20px">
                     <p>Hi, my name is Gordon Hamilton and I'm the creator of the Torsorest, or "mini flight bed" concept.<br><br>
                     During my business life I travelled the world. Twenty years ago it used to amuse and puzzle me that on arrival, even in business class and paying thousands of dollars, the cabin looked more like a camp site after a music festival and the passengers looked equally dishevelled. People just seemed to put up with it.<br><br>
                     What they were putting up with was a rapid change in the way we live our lives. 
                     Over the last 50 years, and certainly since the problem accelerated with the flight of the first jumbo-jet 40 years ago, millions of us are now expected to spend more and more of our travel time confined to a seat.
                     Things may have improved for the business class traveller but not for the 91% of us who ride in the back.
                     With our increasingly hectic lifestyle and our longer and longer multi-modal journeys you would expect the opportunity to sit down, mid journey, and rest or sleep for a few hours might be welcomed. Sadly this is not the case. 100% of passengers trying to sleep while confined to a seat reported it was the worst part of their journey.
                     I’ve seen the same phenomenon on long distance rail and coach journeys and even as a passenger on long car journeys. 
                     One particularly bad twenty four hour coach journey inspired me to figure out what was wrong and do something about it.<br><br>
                     I started to think about the problem from first principles – what makes sleeping in a bed comfortable? And, how could I replicate that experience in a seat?
                     The essence of sleeping on a bed is that all the articulated body parts (head, torso, arms, legs) are supported independently, resulting in almost zero strain on the articulating connections (neck, spine, joints). A secondary benefit of the independent support of body parts is that the sleeping person can move easily, to relieve stiffening joints, without having to consciously wake up. If you have ever watched time lapse photography of someone sleeping on a bed you'll realise how much we need to be able to move even during sleep.<br><br>
                     Contrast this with trying to sleep in a seat. Here the effect of gravity on the body parts causes them to collapse down creating massive strain on the articulating connections: the neck, the spine and all the other joints. Not to mention concentrating all your upper body weight on your lower body, buttocks and thighs.
                     So, the solution lay in finding a way to support, INDEPENDENTLY, those body parts that were unsupported in a seat, namely the head, upper torso, and arms.<br><br>
                     My solution is a product called the torsorest, or ‘Mini Flight Bed’, and is a unique piece of portable furniture, a free standing platform that supports the waist, chest, neck and head, INDEPENDENTLY.
                     The torsorest delivers a highly effective sleep position with natural posture and well balanced weight distribution (half your weight is removed from your buttocks and thighs). It is lightweight, folds flat and occupies approx. 7% of passenger hand luggage. It deploys within your own personal space hindering no-one.
                     It has an added bonus in that it also allows some free movement of joints while sleeping and provides an important alternative sleep position.<br><br>
                     IN SHORT, IT MIMICS CLOSELY ALL THE BENEFITS OF SLEEPING IN A BED.<br><br>
                     Further refinement of the concept:<br>
                     Having established the freestanding platform concept, requiring an extending front leg, you can perhaps anticipate the next step; why not use the extending handle of a wheelie bag for the leg, in fact why not incorporate the Torsorest into the hand-luggage, so that it is always with you when you travel and can be detached when needed. 
                     Extending the concept to luggage. ...any style of bag is possible – business; leisure; back-pack?
                     We have two prototypes that have travelled the world but more importantly they have proved the concept with both consumer focus groups and a university based medical study.<br><br>
                     Market research:<br>
                     - 40% would “buy it now” if it were in stores, the rest were very interested to see the final product. This level of interest in the torsorest confirms the fact that 100% of travellers find trying to sleep when confined to a seat the worst part of their journey. They want a solution, a solution that is long overdue.<br><br>
                     Medical study:<br>
                     “…The forward resting position adopted with the Mini Flight Bed, appears to reduce the lumbar lordosis (unnatural curvature of the spine) … whilst at the same time mitigating compression and shear forces by supporting the weight of the spine and upper body…”
                     “… support against the anterior chest may facilitate relaxation of the erector spine muscle group and therefore reduce back pain or discomfort…”<br><br>
                     ...they concluded:<br>
                     “The opinion of the team is that the Mini Flight Bed has significant potential to improve comfort or reduce discomfort … by facilitating an alternative rest position with upper body support."<br><br>
                     Anecdotes<br>
                     •  Cabin crew report that up to 20% of passengers already attempt to sleep by leaning forward on to their food trays.<br>
                     •  Cabin crew also intimated that the torsorest would be good for them too. Evidently, they often have to wait in terminals between jobs, sometimes for long periods. The torsorest would help them to make use of that 'downtime' by getting some proper sleep. They would like to see it stocked in their 'Crew Outlet' stores
                     This highlights that the torsorest could be useful to anyone stranded in transit by unforeseen events - missed flights, bad weather, volcanic ash clouds – you know, the stuff that always happens to you!<br><br>
                     My conclusions:<br>
                     All things considered I think all cabin-luggage should have the facility to detach a “Mini flight bed” for the benefit of all travellers. It would always be with them as they travel, when and where they need it. I believe that faced with a choice of cabin-luggage to purchase, one with a detachable “Mini flight bed” or one without – the choice would be simple.<br><br>
                     What I believe and what I achieve may very well prove to be two different things, but I’m working on it.</p>

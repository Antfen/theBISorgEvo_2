  <h2>PRINCIPLES FOR THE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS </h2>
    <p>The British Inventors Society (BIS) aspires to the following principles
        as the ethical foundation for the conduct of business. Its members and
        those who seek BIS endorsement are expected to conduct their business
         activities within the spirit of these principles. </p>


    <h2 class="morepadtop">THE  PRINCIPLES:<h2>
    

          <h3>INTEGRITY</h3>
        

          <p>To relate to others in an honest, sincere and ethical manner, such
            that the laws of the land are respected and the good reputation of
            BIS is maintained and enhanced; declaring possible conflicts of interest
            at an appropriately early stage in a discussion or relationship. </p>
       

          <h3>PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS</h3>
       

          <p>To use all reasonable endeavours to provide the best professional
            support to other parties; by being competent, reliable, trustworthy
            and sufficiently open to ensure others do not feel aggrieved by inadequate
            personal performance, or suffer as a result of misbehaviour or misconduct;
            to engage in an appropriate programme of personal professional development. </p>
        

          <h3>RESPECT FOR OTHERS</h3>
      

          <p>To treat others with fairness, discretion and confidentiality -
            whether implied verbally, by informal note or formal undertaking;
            to avoid wasting time or making excessive demands that might impede
            or interfere with the other party's normal business conduct. To show
            courage, constancy and commitment, particularly where any form of
            risk has been taken by the parties involved.</p>
       

          <h3>WISDOM</h3>
       

          <p>To undertake assignments only for which one is competent to act;
            not to impart advice without proper knowledge or relevant experience;
            to make reasonable endeavours to acquire, understand and apply knowledge
            before seeking advice; to learn from others with confidence and humour,
            but not at their expense; to accept rejection with good grace and
            not harbour resentment at apparent failure to meet expectations.</p>
